    <h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h1>

    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong>The purpose of this website is to create a portfolio webpage to showcase my HTML and
        CSS styling skills. </p>

    <p><strong>Audience:</strong>The website is primarily designed for
        Professional peers and developers
        Potential Employers
        Educators and Mentors
        Friends, Tech enthusiasts, Learners.</p>

        <p><strong>Goal:</strong>The single focused goal driving the creation of this portfolio is
        to eventually one day obtain a job because of these skills. </p>

        <h2>Persona</h2>

        <p><strong>Name:</strong>Ron Huckleback</p>

        <p><strong>Profession:</strong>Founder and owner of AnyWayz, a new startup looking for a full-time
            hybrid backend web developers. Their product is a map that updates live to give
            the best route possible while including live traffic.</p>

        <p><strong>Technology:</strong>Strict Windows user. Everything Ron has learned and been taught
            has been involved with a Windows PC. He uses three monitors and a desktop as his main
            way of using the internet but also has a samsung s21 ultra.</p>

        <p><strong>Attitudes & Behaviors: </strong>Ron is desperately looking for qualified candidates to hire but due to being
            a newly founded business owner, finds himself short on time. Ron only has about 45
            minutes a day to look for potential workers for a very important position, he is
            actively seeking candidates through job boards, and community tech events around his
            area. </p>

        <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong>Ron is too short on time to do a traditional interview process with dozens
                of potential hires, he is looking for experienced and entry-level coders as
                his current startup is still in it's beginning stages. Ron realizes reading
                through resumes and cover letters just does not give him a full scope of
                a person's identity as he is looking for someone to develop and stay within
                the company for a few years at least. </p>

        <p><strong>Goals:</strong>Ron has only one interest and that is to hire people to fill his
            back end developer positions. He is faced with a challenge as many business
            owners are and that is being short on time. He needs to know if this person is worthy
            of being interviewed as he is never able to tell from resume's and cover letters alone.</p>

        <p><strong>User Story:</strong>As a visitor, I need to make a choice if the person who made this
            portfolio deserves an interview for a position.</p>
