<h2>Content Strategy:</h2>
<p> On the home page, I plan to feature three main sections that include an about me section
with a picture of myself and links to pages with past projects. I plan to have a unique
     yet clean design with eye-catching colors but not too over the top page design. I plan to then feature an about me section that
details who I am and what I do as well as personal hobbies and interests. I also plan to have
    a separate page linked in the works button near the top dedicated to show/tell what I am learning.
    I also plan to have a projects page that links to a page with links to my previous projects.
    And a footer section to fill in fields to contact me.</p>
